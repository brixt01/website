        <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase programming projects which I have worked on. Having been first introduced to coding in 2013/2014, I have emassed a portfolio of projects written in many different languages (C, C#, Javacript, PHP, HTML, CSS, MATLAB) with the majority being in python, as it was my first language.</p>
        <h2>The layout</h2>
        <p>Each of my previous projects has it own page, on the "Completed projects" page. They contain with a pdf about the project, videos of it in action and a link to a github repository. Projects which I am currently working on are listed on the "Current projects" page, which are likely to change often. If you have any inquiries, please contact me using the "Contact me" page.</p>
